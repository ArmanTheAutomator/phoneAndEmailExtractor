phoneAndEmailExtractor.py
*****************

The phoneAndEmailExtractor script does exactly what its name says it does. 

Copy any block of text to your clipboard and run the program. 

The script will parse through your copied text and extract all phone 
numbers and emails from it. 

It will then display the phones and email onto your terminal as well as 
copy the results on to your clipboard for pasting into another document. 

And that's it!

Enjoy, 

Arman
